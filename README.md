# Project-01 Finding a distributor for the Brazilian market  
## Summary
Eniac, a Spanish based company that sells high-end Apple accessories wants to expand to the Brazilian market and is looking for a distributor to help accomplish this goal. A possible candidate is the company Magist who provided a snapshot of their database. We explored this database and tried to answer whether Magist is a good partner for Eniac's high-end tech products and if Magist's deliveries are fast enough according to Eniac's standards.
## Languages and Libraries Used
MySQL, Tableau, Google slides
## Key Learnings
As a group of three we learned how to define, divide up and assign tasks among ourselves and we learned from our individual findings by sharing our knowledge in frequent meetings. 
We organized our work and switched naturally between individual problem solving and merging our results together in a presentation for Eniac's CEO. We explored the snapshot of the database from Magist and came up with different aspects we could focus on to answer the main questions to be able to make an informed decision regarding Magist as a potential partner.
## Challenges Overcame
Finishing this case study in a short time in which we also had to learn working with the visualization tool Tableau, getting to know the other group members and how they work and putting together a clear presentation was very challenging. Getting feedback after a rehearsal on the day before the final presentation helped tremendously in understanding what we actually wanted to tell and convey to our CEO and where we should focus on, which enabled us to improve and complete the presentation in less than a day.    
## Additional Reflections
Working on this project showed it is possible to accomplish a complex and completely new task under time pressure, using new tools, working in a group with people that are new to you and practicing presentation skills, which I found a challenging, rewarding and empowering experience.
